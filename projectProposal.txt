As you can read in the description of this porject. We are making an education portal
that will meet the requirments of this project. We are going to start with a credential 
sign on that the user (students) will need to log in with certian credentials. 
Secondly we are going to have options where you will submit assignments to be graded.
We then will add the option of using zoom/other virtual meeting software. This is to 
allow the students to meet with other students. 
Finally we are going to add a messaging system, that you can directly talk with the professors.

The target audience obviously, is going to be students, which we though was fitting 
for all of us as we are students as well.
